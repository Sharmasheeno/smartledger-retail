## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray (#F5F7FA) provides a clean and professional backdrop.

- Use modern, vector-style icons to represent menu items and data points.
- Employ a card-based layout to organize data and provide a clean, intuitive user experience, adapting fluidly to different screen sizes.
